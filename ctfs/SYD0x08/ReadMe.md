This challenge was designed as a scripting based challenge that runs on a Linux x64 system, however there is of course other ways to solve this challenge aside from using scripting. 

The binary “Pokemon” requires you to complete the questions correctly within 10 seconds and then complete the password challenge at the end. Once you have correctly entered the password the flag will be relived.

The source code has also been provided if you want to have a look how the whole application works or compile it for another OS, along with the start of a python script to help you out if you get stuck.


Good luck!
